# HeartDiseaseClassifier

These models link to the anvil web app https://harmless-lavish-earth.anvil.app/. The goal is to determine whether or not a patient had heart disease. Three neural network models were implemented: SVM, KNN, and RBF, using the UCI heart disease dataset from Cleveland to analyze the patients data. The results of all three models and their accuracy are displayed for comparison through the web application.
